## Summary

Oxygen for Democracy (formerly Oxygono) is a non-profit non-governmental organisation registered in 2014 and based in Cyprus. It works to improve the policy-making process in Cyprus and to make it more participatory, transparent and scientific. It consists of people from a wide range of backgrounds. It is a fully independent organisation governed by a five-member board of directors, a ten-member executive committee and a number of advisory bodies.

The organisation won the European Citizen's Prize 2022 by the European Parliament.

It currently organises a number of projects such as the Cyprus Forum, the Cyprus Forum Cities and Nomoplatform, where all parliamentary laws are tracked.

I have been a co-founder of the NGO, when initially began its life as a blog during the economic crisis in southern Europe, along with Nicolas Kyriakides, Antonis Kouroutakis and Michalis Risvas. I have served in its executive committee for the past decade.
